<p align="justify">This is a mobile game where you associate letters with numbers. Players must progress through increasingly difficult turns.
As the turns advance, the challenges become more challenging and faster. The objective is to select letters that are either smaller or larger than the letter in the center of the screen. 
Larger letters refer to those closer to the end of the alphabet, while smaller letters are those closer to the beginning of the alphabet.</p>
